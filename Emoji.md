Emoji are the ideograms or smileys used in Japanese electronic messeges and webpages,
the use of which is spreading outside Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word
emoji literally means "picture"(e) + "character"(moji). The characters are used much like
ASCIIemoticons or kaomoi, but a wider range is provided, and the icons are standardized
and built into the handsets. Some emoji are very specific to Japanese culture, such as a
bowing(apologizing) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to
denote "brilliant homework" or a group of emoji representing popularfoods: ramen
noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi. The three main Japanese operators,
NTT DoCoMo, au, and SoftBank Mobile(formerly Vodafone), have each defined their own
variants of emoji.


Although originally only available in Japan, some emoji character sets have been
incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere as well. As a result, some
phones such as the Windows Phone and the iPhone lines allow access to the symbols
without requireing a Japanese carrier. Emoji have also started appearing in emailing
services such as Gmail(accessed via Google Labs) in April 2009 and websites such as
Flipnote Hatena. Apple's Mac OS X operating system supports emoji as of version 10.7
Lion with the Apple color Emoji typeface.


### History
The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the
team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile internet platform. The first set of 172 12*12
pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitete
electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.
