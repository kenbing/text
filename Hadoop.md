The Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:
* Hadoop Common - contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules
* Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) - a distributed file-system that stores data on
commodity machines, providing very aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.
* Hadoop YARN
